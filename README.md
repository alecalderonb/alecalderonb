Hi! I'm Alejandro, I'm a biology PhD student in the Uricchio lab at Tufts University. 
I study evolutionary genetics and population persistence in a variety of species including slipper limpet, European corn borer, and sagebrush (Crepidula fornicata, Ostrinia nubilalis, and Artemisia tridentata, respectively).
I incorporate computational tools with genomic data to study signatures of different evolutionary dynamics.
